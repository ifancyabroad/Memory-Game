# Memory Game
## About
### Description
This is a simple unofficial **web application** memory game based on the popular _Pokemon_ franchise. The game involves matching pairs of cards until they are all revealed, at this point the user has a choice to start over again. The game keeps track of the time taken and how many moves are made and displays a rating based on how well the user performed.

### Origins
The game was created as part of the _Udacity_ Front-End Nanodegree course. It was created from scratch with the exception of the `shuffle` function which is credited in the code comments.

### Process
Some the **challenges** faced while developing the application are as follows:
- Associating JavaScript objects with DOM elements
- Creating an interactive 'card' with two faces
- Using the `event.target` method
- Applying animations to specific objects
- Using the `setTimeout` method
- Testing the app across different devices and browsers

## Installation
To install the app simply clone/download this repository and open index.html in your browser.

## Instructions
1. Click a card to flip it over
2. Click a second card and check if it matches
3. Repeat above steps until all cards are revealed

## Dependancies
- jQuery (JavaScript library found [here](https://jquery.com))
- Font Awesome (font and CSS toolkit found [here](http://fontawesome.io/))
- Google Fonts (font library found [here](https://fonts.google.com/))
